        <p> People often feel good and experience sense of accomplishment when they perform a simple task of cleaning after their desk. This is not just a personality trait rather, it might be a neurological state related to how we experience self identification to objects around us. Decluttering, or removing belongings that are unwanted and unneeded has recently become a new craze in America thanks to Japanese author Marie Kondo’s New York Times best seller book “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing.” Kondo’s decluttering theory is to discard anything that doesn’t spark joy. But this task is not as easy for many people. In a study, students from Yale School of Medicine brought in both hoarders and non-hoarders, and asked them to go through some stuff and declutter. The participants had to decide on their own what to keep and what to toss away from the clutter. While tracking their brain activity, the students found out that those who hoard showed increased activity in two parts of their brains: the cingulate cortex and the insula, these regions of the brain are associated with conflict and pain. The stronger the activation in these parts, the higher the feeling discomfort and anxiety. On top of this negative brain activity, Neuroscientists at Princeton University found that physical clutter can also impact a person’s ability to focus and process information, making them feel unaccomplished and stressed. Digital clutter can have similar effect as physical clutter, for example when a mailbox is filled with emails and a messy desktop, one feels defeated and unproductive.  Just like physical and digital clutter, one’s mind also needs tidying up from time to time or it can also turn into a chaotic mess.
A practical solution to these is to declutter physical, digital and mental state. The concept of decluttering and it’s health benefits have been increasingly recognized, especially the mental health. Through decluttering, one can feel sense of accomplishment and self-care.
Most common approaches to decluttering: Start out in small loads and not to overwhelm oneself with the amount of things to get rid of. Then discard any just-in-case items, for they can be replaced easily when needed. After decluttering through physical items, making sure to say a grateful farewell, as Marie Kondo suggests it helps one ‘spark joy’- acknowledging the presence of the objects and knowing they will be happily worn or used in the future. Once the physical space is decluttered, next step is to declutter digital space, by disciplining oneself to removing emails - this can also spark joy. Lastly, decluttering the mind is necessary, by taking the time to unwind, breathing, and limiting amount of media intake.
The outcome of all this decluttering is not just a tidier environment, but it can be life changing and mind freeing.
