        <h1> Project Brief</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
        <h2> Topic Summary </h2>
        <p> “Declutter” is an engaging eLearning interactive website designed to inform visitors to declutter physical, digital and emotional space. </p>
        <h2> Target Audience Description </h2>
        <p> Declutter’s target audience are University members, who are in the process of transitioning from living under care to living on their own. The site also reaches individuals who need guidance on decluttering physical space and freeing out mind
            space during busy and hectic student schedules.
        </p>
        <h2> Goals of the Project </h2>
        <p> “Declutter” website engages users and subtly motivates them to clear out their own physical space as they learn to clean the space in the website. There will be three main rooms, bedroom, bathroom and living room. Depending on which room they
            enter, various objects belonging to the room will be cluttered around everywhere. Each object represents different aspects in our physical, digital and emotional space to declutter. Users will be provided with useful and simple tips and tricks
            on how to clean areas related to the selected topic/object. The site also link out to other helpful and detailed websites where the user can explore more on organizing and decluttering. With the new gained knowledge, users will implement it
            in their own lives and form good decluttering habits. The website also provides value to users by implementing emotional design into the website. For example, users feel good when the cluttered items automatically declutter and disappear from
            the room once a user clicks and views the information. After using the interactive website, users will feel prompted to clean their own space.</p>
        <h2> Visual Strategy</h2>
        <p>The site will be easy to navigate, with simple layout but complex visuals to entertain the user. The site will set an environment and provide a narrative to give directions to the viewer. This is a way to keep the user engaged while explaining
            instructions and guides in a storyline. By implementing inviting bright colors, isometric graphics and applying simple animation effects to objects, the site will attract people of all ages to interact and play. </p>
